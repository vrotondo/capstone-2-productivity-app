In this project, you’ll build a full-stack productivity application that solves a real-world user problem. You’ll design and implement a complete software system from scratch using React for the frontend and Flask for the backend. The app should store user-created data in a relational database, provide a responsive interface, and allow for full CRUD operations on at least two related resources (minimum—more are encouraged if your app concept supports it).

In this project, you’ll define your own business problem and solution, aligning your idea with user needs. You’ll demonstrate your ability to scope, build, debug, and refine a full-stack application using professional tools and workflows.

Scenario
You’re encouraged to integrate a third-party API or an AI-powered service (e.g., OpenAI, weather, scheduling, or time-tracking) if it enhances your application, but this is optional. What matters most is that your app solves a clearly scoped productivity-related problem through thoughtful user interface and backend design.

Your project will have the following requirements: 

Design the data models, API endpoints, and React component structure.
Implement CRUD functionality and user interaction flows.
Handle asynchronous communication between frontend and backend.
Manage application state, loading/error handling, and persistence.
Write clean, modular, and reusable code.
Present your final product via a professional video walkthrough and written reflection.
The solution should be grounded in a real-world problem that users face, whether it’s productivity, education, creativity, wellness, or another domain. You are responsible for building the frontend and backend from scratch and delivering a working, documented, and demo-ready product.

Deliverables
You must produce the following:

Part 1: Project Pitch
This pitch simulates the planning phase of a professional product lifecycle, helping you strengthen your ability to define project goals, structure your workflow, and deliver a scoped, achievable product.

Part 2: Minimum Viable Project (MVP) Discussion
In this discussion, you’ll be sharing a ~90% complete version, or MVP (Minimum Viable Product, of your full-stack Productivity application. This version should include the core functionality and structure, such as working user authentication, at least two interactive resources, and database integration.

Part 3: Project 2- Productivity Full-Stack Application
A GitHub repo with all frontend and backend code.

A functioning Flask backend with at least 2 database tables and corresponding models (minimum). You may extend this with more tables if needed.
A React frontend that manages app state, displays API responses, and interacts with user input.
A README with installation and usage instructions, routes, API info, and screenshots.
Part 4: Showcase Productivity Full-Stack Application- Discussion
For this final showcase, you will present your Productivity Full-Stack Application in a video walkthrough (max 10 minutes) and provide a concise visual aid (e.g., slide deck, live demo, or annotated code walkthrough).

Your goal is to explain how your project solves a real-world problem, highlight your technical decision-making, and demonstrate both frontend and backend features.

You will also share a written reflection about your development process and participate in a peer review to give and receive actionable feedback.

For more specific instructions: Project 2 Assignment: Productivity Full-Stack Application Pitch
Before you begin development on your full-stack productivity app, you’ll need to plan and communicate your vision clearly, just like you would on a real software team. This pitch simulates the planning phase of a professional product lifecycle, helping you strengthen your ability to define project goals, structure your workflow, and deliver a scoped, achievable product.

This assignment helps you develop key software engineering skills including:

Scoping and requirement gathering
Communicating technical and business goals
Designing problem-solving processes and workflows
Planning iterative development across a multi-stage build
A strong pitch ensures your idea is realistic, feasible, and aligned with the project rubric and business impact. Reminder on requirements for your project to keep in mind while developing your pitch:

Be built entirely from scratch by you.
Solve a user productivity issue, such as generating reports,viewing data, managing projects and assigned tasks, etc.
Include at least 2 relational resources in the backend (e.g., users, projects, dashboards, requests, responses, logs, tasks, notes).
Allow for basic CRUD on at least one custom resource.
Store generated responses in a SQL database using SQLAlchemy.
Include error handling for failed requests.
Instructions
You will submit a short project pitch that includes the following three components:

Step 1: Business Problem Scenario
Write a clear explanation of:

The user problem your app solves in the domain of productivity (e.g., time management, task tracking, organization).
Who your target users are and what daily frustrations they face.
Why your solution adds value (e.g., streamlines workflows, reduces friction, saves time).
If applicable, mention how an external API or AI service will extend the app’s usefulness.
Define your project’s primary goal(s) and a few examples of user stories your app should support.
Example Prompts
What productivity pain point are you solving?
How will users interact with your app?
What will make your app unique or helpful?

Step 2: Problem Solving Process
Define your project plan and technical strategy. Your answer should include:

A step-by-step process (3–7 steps) for how you’ll build your app.
Pro-Tip: Use the Software Development Lifecycle Tasks.
A conceptual outline, such as:
A high-level flowchart, pseudocode, or list of app features
Your planned data models and how they relate
Planned React component breakdown
The tools and technologies you'll use (e.g., Flask, SQLAlchemy, React Router, useState/useEffect).
Mention where your process aligns with the project rubric: full CRUD, 2+ related resources, clean UI, documentation, optional API integration, etc.

Step 3: Timeline and Scope
Create a realistic timeline for completing your app. Break the project into phases and estimate your time for each:

Planning and research
Backend setup and modeling
Frontend structure and styling
Debugging and testing
README, presentation, reflection
Timeline and Scope Considerations
Time-box your work across the total project timeframe
Identify when you may need to research APIs, tools, or libraries
Include time for debugging and iteration (e.g., after peer critique)
Call out any open questions or risks (e.g., “Need to learn Flask pagination”, “API integration may require key handling”)

Submission and Grading Criteria
Review the rubric below to guide you in your submission and for details on the required criteria.
When you are ready, upload your pitch as a document (such as a Google Doc). Include any assets embedded in the document to submit it below. Make sure your final document is:
Clearly organized under the three required sections
1–2 pages in length
Optionally include diagrams, flowcharts, or wireframes as images or links
